**Train Scheduler**

A basic train scheduling app that allows the user to view incoming train information in the **Current Train Schedule** table, and
add new information via the **Add Train Form** including train name, final destination, first train time, next arrival time and how many minutes away the train is.

This app also allows the user to easily remove a train from the schedule by clicking the remove button.
